    <h1>About Ganesh Welding Works</h1>
    <p>Founded in the heart of Pathankot , <strong>Ganesh Welding Works</strong> is more than a metal workshop—it's a place where ideas take shape, and steel meets sentiment.</p>

    <p>We believe welding isn’t just about joining metals. For us, it’s the process of joining emotions, creating strength, and shaping happiness for every customer we serve.</p>

    <p>From rooftops to railings, every project is crafted by a team that treats each piece like a part of their own home. No shortcuts, no compromises—only quality work done with pride, safety, and heart.</p>

    <p>We’re not a company. We’re a <em>family</em>. And when you work with us, you become part of it.</p>
